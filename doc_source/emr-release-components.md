# About Amazon EMR Releases<a name="emr-release-components"></a>

An Amazon EMR release is a set of open\-source applications from the big\-data ecosystem\. Each release comprises different big\-data applications, components, and features that you select to have Amazon EMR install and configure when you create a cluster\. Applications are packaged using a system based on [Apache BigTop](http://bigtop.apache.org/), which is an open\-source project associated with the Hadoop ecosystem\. This guide provides information for applications included in Amazon EMR releases\.

For more information about getting started and working with Amazon EMR, see the [Amazon EMR Management Guide](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ManagementGuide/)\.

When you launch a cluster, you can choose from multiple release versions of Amazon EMR\. This allows you to test and use application versions that fit your solution's compatibility requirements\. For more information about each Amazon EMR release, see the following topics in this guide\.
